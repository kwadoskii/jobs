                                        My name is Gabriel Abonga, a graduate of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, with
                                        Second Class Honors Upper Division in Electronic Engineering.

                                    <p>
                                        I wish to apply for the position of PHP Engineer currently being advertised in your firm. I
                                        believe the knowledge I have acquired through my course work and the skills I picked up over
                                        my course of working in the Information Technology industry makes me an ideal candidate for
                                        this opening.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        I am interested in this position as it appeals directly to my passion for working in a
                                        fast-paced information technology environment. As a developer this role appears directly to
                                        me, I equally write PHP, HTML, CSS, SCSS, Javascript, React, SQL, NO-SQL and JQuery.
                                    </p>

                                    <p>
                                        In addition to my degree qualification, I also took a course towards public management where
                                        I got a certification from the Chartered Institute of Public Managers of Nigeria.
                                    </p>
